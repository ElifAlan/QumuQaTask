## Project Title: QumuQa Task

  In GitHub you will find 2 projects:

### QumuQa Project:

  This is the original project which you have sent me. I have 

   - Removed all the dependencies in the task and added new dependencies
   - Removed some paths and added some new paths in the structure
   - Used Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
   - Implemented my own Driver Class built based on singleton design pattern
   - Designed and implemented utility classes
   - Stored all configuration details in properties files named “TestData.properties”
   - Used TestDataReader class to read all details in properties files TestData.properties
   - Used Plugins to generate cucumber-report (RunnerTest / CukesRunner class) and to run only failed tests (RunnerTest / FailedTestRunner class)

### QumuMaven Project:

  This is the project I have designed and implemented from scratch based on the requirements.
